# Tip-Gro
## Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
## Description:
  For this project, I have decided to use the Next.js framework in order to build my web application.
  My web application was something that I had wanted to make and also would have liked to have in my day-to-day life.
  For my web application I made a Tip Trascker for my Part Time job at a reasturant where most of my income is made with tips, So i made something in order to track my tips and how much i am making within a given week/month/etc..  


## Create Your Own:

  ![Click the link to sign up](public/README_images/signup.png)

  - once you've signed up it will automaticlly log you in and bring you to the home page(index.js) 
  


  - this has a breif description of myself and what i am striving to do, I am using this as a placeholder for now but i do want to add more features later on including: (User Profile/Dashboard, weekly overviews, monthly overviews, deleting events, editing events, adding multiple day logs, using the hamberger icon in top right for user quick access)




## Step 2: Navigate to the Calendar Page

  - but for now you are gonna see right above the description of myself there is going to be a link to the calendar which is the main part of my app.
  
  ![Click on the Calendar link above the body paragraph](public/README_images/Step2.png)


## Calendar

  - Once you have entered the calendar you should see this page:

![Calendar Image ](public/README_images/calendar.png)

 - Now you have to calendar up you can now add events, only to todays day at the moment, providing support for multiple day events/logs will come later on.
 - if you click on todays day a popup will showup asking you for your shift start time and end time where you have a time input for easy inputing, also right below those you will have your tip amout.
 - You can enter in some values into these inputs and get ready to save the event:
  
  ![Popup Image](public/README_images/modal-empty.png)
  ![Popup Image](public/README_images/modal-filled.png)

- Once you have everything entered in you can now hit save, Don't  worry it may take some time--if nothing happens after 5 seconds then please click on the save button one more time, then it should work (currently working on a loading Icon for user feedback):

![saved event](public/README_images/saved-event.png)


- This is the base of my project You can add events to todays date and it will add the event to the calendar with the title telling yoiu the amount you made that shift
